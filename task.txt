Try to solve these four problems:
1. Given a website address as a string, extract the domain name. For example, if the website address is "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page", then it should return "en.wikipedia.org" as the domain name.
2. Given a website address as a string, find out if the website is secure or not. A website address starting with "http" is not secure and a website with "https" is secure.
3. Mass of earth is 5.972 x 10 power 24. Represent this value in a variable and print the same.
4. Given a right angle triangle with sides a, b and c. As per Pythagoras theorem the hypotenuse side c can be calculated as square root of a square plus b square. Write a program to compute the hypotenuse, when a and b are provided.




Task1 - Convert every word's last letter to upper case
Task2 - If the word is of odd length then convert middle letter to uppercase else convert first                                                  letter to uppercase
Task3 - In every word if it is not palindrome then reverse it and print back the whole sentence.  
 



 * 1)Find Nth  max in array, remember it will have duplicates
 * 2)Take an array and remove all duplicates in it
 * 3)Find all the palindrome numbers in array
 * 4)Find all prime numbers in array
 * 5)Take array as input remove the digits where the first value and last value is same
 * eg [101,22,344,699]-> in this 101 and 22 should be removed because the first digit and last is same
 * so output will be [344,699]
